# GOTdict
A dictionary in StarDict format for George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire / Game of Thrones.  
It is based on the work of KEC Krew and inspired by https://github.com/wjdp/gotdict.

# Why did I create this dictionary?
A community-built version of this dictionary is available for Kindle at https://github.com/wjdp/gotdict.  
A version for Kobo is available as part of the work on dictutil at https://github.com/pgaskin/dictutil.  
There are, however, people like me who use ePaper tablets with larger screens like the BOOX Note Pro, which use the StarDict format.
