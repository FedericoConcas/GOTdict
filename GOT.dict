Harren the Black, the King of the Iron Islands and the Riverlands, was nearing completion of his massive castle, Harrenhal, and was said to be looking for more conquests.

He offered the hand of his daughter, Argella, in marriage as well as dowry lands, though, much of the lands were in fact in the possession of Harren the Black. Aegon refused and instead offered the hand of his best friend and rumored bastard brother, Orys Baratheon. Argilac took this as a grave insult and had the hands of the envoy cut off. He sent them to Aegon with a message of These are the only hands you will receive. Aegon called his banners and took counsel with them and his sisters. Then Aegon sent ravens to the rulers of the Seven Kingdoms. He informed them that There will be only one King and that those who bent the knee would keep their lands and titles. But those that did not he would destroy. King Argilac refused to submit. After landing and proclaiming himself Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and King of Westeros, Aegon named Orys Baratheon the Hand of the King and sent him with Rhaenys to take Storm's End. Though Orys met with some setbacks, he continued to march on Storm's End. King Argilac refused to be trapped inside his castle like King Harren, so he came out to meet the invaders. He attacked Orys's forces while a huge storm raged, in what became known as the Battle of the Last Storm. Argilac outnumbered Orys' army two-to-one and outflanked it, but Rhaenys and her dragon, Meraxes, stopped them. Orys came face-to-face with Argilac and slew him in single combat. In order to reward his rumored bastard half-brother Orys, Aegon gave him Argilac's lands and the hand of the dead king's daughter.

The Greyjoys became the lords paramount of the Iron Isles during the Targaryen Conquest: after Aegon I extinguished House Hoare, he allowed the ironborn to choose who would have primacy over them. They chose Vickon Greyjoy and his line. The Greyjoys have ruled ever since, from their formidable castle of Pyke. The ironborn, however, did lose the Riverlands, which were granted to Edmyn Tully and his descendents.  Thus relegated to their dismal homeland and constrained by the king's peace, the Greyjoys have kept themselves distant from the other Great Houses, rarely taking part in events on the mainland (which they call the green lands). At various times they have tried to return to their ancient practices of raiding the western coastlines, such as under Lord Dagon.

The Greyirons were the High Kings of the Iron Islands for a thousand years.  For centuries, the High King of the Isles had been chosen between the lords and captains of the Iron Islands in a kingsmoot. Five thousand years before the War of the Five Kings, Urron Greyiron descended with his axemen among the ironborn assembled on Nagga's Bones, murdering all their opponents and proclaiming himself king.

The Greyjoys became the lords paramount of the Iron Isles during the Targaryen Conquest: after Aegon I extinguished House Hoare, he allowed the ironborn to choose who would have primacy over them. They chose Vickon Greyjoy and his line. The Greyjoys have ruled ever since, from their formidable castle of Pyke. The ironborn, however, did lose the Riverlands, which were granted to Edmyn Tully and his descendents.  Thus relegated to their dismal homeland and constrained by the king's peace, the Greyjoys have kept themselves distant from the other Great Houses, rarely taking part in events on the mainland (which they call the green lands). At various times they have tried to return to their ancient practices of raiding the western coastlines, such as under Lord Dagon. Six years after holding aloof during Robert's Rebellion, Lord Balon Greyjoy led his own rebellion against the Iron Throne, declaring himself King of the Iron Islands.

House Hightower was integral in the Citadel's foundation, and continues to patronize the order. As advisers to the Westerosi nobility, the maesters have largely supplanted the Alchemists' Guild. They are sometimes called the knights of the mind.  The maesters are scholars, scientists, learned advisors to the nobility, and occasionally pseudo-religious researchers in the occult. Males of any age may begin training as a maester; females are not permitted to study or join the order. Noble families in Westeros sometimes send their younger sons to the Citadel. A bastard may study at the Citadel and become a maester. The maesters, like the brothers of the Night's Watch, are considered to be servants of Westeros and all its people and in theory have no political allegiance. After finishing his course of study, a maester is assigned to a castle, keep or other holding, and is loyal to the people of that place as a mentor, healer and adviser, regardless of changes in control of that holding. To this end a man who earns his chain is stripped of his family name and from that time on is known only by his title and first name. In practice some maesters hold over old allegiances and loyalties.Maester Aemon is an ancient man of a hundred years old. He is bald, wrinkled, shrunken and blind.

He was a fearless warrior, who was named the thirteenth Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. Later he fell in love with a woman with skin as white as the moon and eyes like blue stars, he chased her and loved her though her skin was cold as ice, and when he gave his seed to her he gave his soul as well. (Her description matches that of the Others.)  He brought her back to the Nightfort and after the unholy union, he declared himself king and her his queen, and ruled the Nightfort as his own castle for thirteen years. During the dark years of his reign, horrific atrocities were committed, of which tales are still told in the North. It was not until his own brother, the King in the North, and Joramun, the King-Beyond-the-Wall, joined forces that the Night's King was brought down and the Night's Watch freed. After his fall, when it was discovered that he had been sacrificing to the Others (possibly in similar way to Craster), all records of him were destroyed and his very name was forbidden. It is likely this led the lords of the North to forbid the Night's Watch to construct walls at their keeps, ensuring the keeps would always be accessible from the south.The Night's Watch is a military order dedicated to holding the Wall, the immense fortification on the northern border of the Seven Kingdoms, defending the realms of men from what lies beyond. The order's foundation dates back to the Age of Heroes, at the time when the Others were pushed back. The men of Night's Watch wear only black.  The Night's Watch consists of three orders: Rangers, Builders, and Stewards. All of them are subject to the Lord Commander and each of the three orders is led by its own officer, called First Ranger, First Builder, and First Steward, respectively. These officers are appointed by the Lord Commander.  The Night's Watch is one of the oldest orders in the Seven Kingdoms, as it survived the fall of the kingdoms of the First Men, following the Andal Invasion, and the War of Conquest. It was founded over 8,000 years ago, after the period known as the Long Night. Under cover of an endless night that lasted for a generation, the Others invaded from the Lands of Always Winter, laying waste to much of Westeros, until the Others were finally defeated by the Night's Watch at the Battle for the Dawn. After having pushed back the threat, the Wall was built by Brandon the Builder in order to protect the Seven Kingdoms, should the Others ever return. During the Age of Heroes it was also recorded by the Night's Watch that the children of the forest gave the Night's Watch a hundred obsidian daggers every year.The Nightflyer is an ironborn longship owned by House Blacktyde. Its captain is Lord Baelor Blacktyde.The Nightfort is one of the castles along the Wall. It is the only castle along the Wall where the steps up the side of the Wall were carved into the ice. It was abandoned by the Night's Watch two hundred years before the War of the Five Kings. The last brothers to inhabit the castle were reassigned to Deep Lake. It sits between Icemark to the west and Deep Lake to the east. It was the first castle on the Wall, and the largest. With the dwindling of Night's Watch power it became three-quarters empty and too costly to maintain. When Good Queen Alysanne Targaryen suggested to pay for a new smaller castle, the Watch agreed to abandon it. The new castle, Deep Lake, was paid for by the queen's jewels and built by men that King Jaehaerys I sent north. Once the new castle was completed, the Nightfort was abandoned.  Three hundred years before Aegon's Landing, the commanders of the Nightfort and Snowgate went to war with each other. Eventually, both lost their heads to the Starks of Winterfell.  It is remembered in scary stories of the North, although doubtlessly many of them are false. It was there that Night's King reigned before his name was wiped from the memory of man, and where the Rat Cook served the Andal king his prince-and-bacon pie, where the 79 sentinels stood their watch, where brave young Danny Flint had been raped and murdered, where King Sherrit had called down his curse of the Andals of old, where the apprentice boys had faced the thing that came in the night, where blind Symeon Star-Eyes had seen the Hellhounds fight, and where Mad Axe had walked the yards and climbed the towers to butcher his brothers in the dark.The Nightingale is a famous courtesan in Braavos, renowned for her beauty.Nightsong is the seat of House Caron.

The region covers the entire area south of the Wall and north of the Neck.  The North has been ruled by House Stark for thousands of years from the castle known as Winterfell. Other notable houses of the region include Bolton, Umber, Karstark, and Manderly. Bastards born in the North are given the surname Snow.  The North' is vast in size, it is the largest of the Seven Kingdoms regions, nearly as large as the the other six kingdoms combined. The region is sparsely populated, with vast wilderness, forests, pine-covered hills and snow-capped mountains, speckled with tiny villages and holdfasts. Its climate is cold and harsh in the winter and occasionally it will snow even in the summer.  The North has two major land barriers. First, to the north is the Wall, home of the Night's Watch, who defend its northern border from the wildling threat from the Beyond the Wall. Second, to the south is the triangle of impassable bogs and marshes of the Neck.

It is the only crossing point over the Green Fork for hundreds of miles in either direction, from the North to the western Riverlands. It lies directly athwart the main route from Winterfell to Riverrun.  It took the Freys three generations to complete the fortress, starting six hundred years ago with timber keeps on either bank of the river. Since then, the Freys have grown wealthy by charging a heavy toll on all those who need to cross - a fact which irks many older or more powerful houses. The timber keeps have since been replaced by stone. These castles are what give the stronghold its name, for they are identical. They have high curtain walls, deep moats and a barbican and portcullis in each. The bridge footings rise from within the inner keeps. Given their strong castle, strategic location, wealth, and numbers, the Freys are one of the most powerful bannerhouses sworn to House Tully, able to raise four thousand men-at-arms.

Most of its area is covered by a political entity known as the Seven Kingdoms. Two other continents that share the world in which Westeros resides are Essos, a vast continent, lies in the east across the Narrow Sea, and Sothoros, south east of Westeros across the Summer Sea. The closest foreign nations to Westeros are the Free Cities, a collection of independent city-states along the western edge of Essos. The lands along the southern coastline, collectively called the Lands of the Summer Sea, include Ghis and the ruins of Valyria, the former home of Westeros's Targaryen kings. To the south of Westeros lie the Summer Islands.  The continent of Westeros is long and relatively narrow, extending from Dorne in the south to the Lands of Always Winter in the far north, where a large amount of land remains uncharted, due to the extremely cold temperatures and hostile inhabitants known as wildlings. Although no scale appears on the maps in the books themselves, George R. R. Martin has stated that the Wall is a hundred leagues long, or three hundred miles. Thus the continent stretches for about 3,000 miles from north to south and for some 900 miles at its widest point east to west.  Its eastern coast borders on the Narrow Sea; across those waters lies the eastern continent of Essos and the island chain known as the Stepstones. To the south is located the Summer Sea, and within it the Summer Islands.  The northern lands of Westeros are less densely populated than the south despite their roughly equivalent size. The five major cities of Westeros are, in order of size: King's Landing, Oldtown, Lannisport, Gulltown, and White Harbour.  Westeros was originally divided into several independent kingdoms before the consolidation of the War of Conquest. After this war and the eventual incorporation of Dorne, all the regions south of the Wall were united under the rule of House Targaryen into a nation that is known as the Seven Kingdoms.Wex Pyke is the bastard son of Sargon Botley of Lordsport.
